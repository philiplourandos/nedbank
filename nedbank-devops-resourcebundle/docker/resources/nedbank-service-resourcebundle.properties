key.1=Kurt continues, I have talked with our numerous internal customers, and they told me how important Data Hub is. But they also told me about how we're often the bottleneck for changes needed across the enterprise, as well as for the Phoenix Project. And as we all know, when our service goes down, so does Phoenix. I have scheduled a session later this week for us to brainstorm how we can make our service more reliable and resilient.
key.2=She thinks of Erik's Second Ideal of Focus, Flow, and Joy. All the joy she felt vaporized when Tom told her that they had completed only a small portion of the work needed to create value. That's just not good enough for her. In her MRP team, any developer could test their own code and even push code into production themselves. They didn't have to wait weeks for other people to do that work for them. Being able to test and push code to production is more productive, makes for happier customers, creates accountability of code quality to the people who write it, and also makes the work more joyful and rewarding.
key.3=Data is the lifeblood of the company, she continues. In Marketing, almost all of us access or manipulate data to guide the efforts of the company. For the first time, thanks to the Panther platform that Shannon and team created, we can finally get the data we need, trust that it is correct, and use all sorts of statistical techniques and even things like machine learning to predict what our customers might need. This is what we use to craft offers and promotions. I have no doubt that the future of the organization will be built upon understanding our customers and providing them what they need...and we are best able to do that by understanding this data.
key.4=Typing in these VIN numbers is the bane of almost every Parts Unlimited employee, she says, resulting in knowing chuckles from all around the room. All of you have worked in-store. You know how difficult and error-prone this is. We now enable customers to use their app to create a profile for all of their cars. They just scan the VIN on their car using their phone camera, and we automatically populate the information of their car: make, model, year, and we can even pull in records from Carfax and other services.
key.5=An hour afer the meeting with Steve adjourned, I'm still mulling over Erik's cryptic comments. I feel like we're on the verge of something big, but I have too many questions. I finally decide to call him.
key.6=By midday Thursday, right in the middle of tanksgiving, we knew we were in trouble. The overnight Unicorn e-mail promotion was an incredible success. The response rate was unprecedentedly high, with traffic to our website surging to record levels, which kept bringing down our e-commerce systems. We initiated an emergency Sev 1 call, putting in all sorts of emergency measures to maintain our ability to take orders, including putting more servers into rotation and turning off computationally-intensive features. Ironically, one of the developers suggested turning off all the real-time recommendations, which we had worked so hard to build. Why recommend more products to buy, he argued, if customers can't even complete a transaction?
